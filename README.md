# NEXT-WORD-PREDICTION-USING-LSTM-AND-GRU
  One of the subfields of natural language processing that can assist with predicting the next word are
  called next-word prediction, which is also sometimes referred as language modeling. One of the
  applications of machine learning is this. The process can be summed up by saying that it involves
  guessing the next word in a sentence. This paper discusses how to use a neural model that is more
  advanced than a basic RNN and use it to predict the next word. It has many applications that are used by
  most of us, such as auto-correct, which is mostly used in emails or messages. Long-Short Term Memory
  (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit, is the model that is used to work in this paper. The deep learning model
  described in this paper was constructed with the assistance of the TensorFlow library, which was
  programmed in Python. This paper is carried out for three books as data to predict the next word using the
  LSTM and GRU models. In this paper, an investigation of LSTM and GRU models is carried out, and the
  results are compared and interpreted for Metamorphosis, MotherEarth, The strange case of Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde datasets 
  which was taken from Gutenberg e-book collection website.
